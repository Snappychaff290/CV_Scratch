      <p class="overview-description">
        The main purpose of this page, more accurately this series of pages, is
        to document my journey in web development so myself and others can look
        back on how much has changed. I do not plan on formatting these pages to
        be super good looking as that is not the point, I want to focus more
        time on the actual content of the pages, maybe this will change in the
        future, if it does, chances are you won't be seeing this.
      </p>

      <p class="first-description">
        As I am eager to start my first mockup of the landing page, I am leaving
        this page pretty much as ugly as you can imagine, I will include an
        image below of what it looks like, beware! It's barebones
      </p>
