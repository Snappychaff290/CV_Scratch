            <p class="description">
              The main purpose of this page, more accurately this series of
              pages, is to document my journey in web development so myself and
              others can look back on how much has changed. I do not plan on
              formatting these pages to be super good looking as that is not the
              point, I want to focus more time on the actual content of the
              pages, maybe this will change in the future, if it does, chances
              are you won't be seeing this.

              As I am eager to start my first mockup of the landing page, I am
              leaving this page pretty much as ugly as you can imagine, I will
              include an image below of what it looks like, beware! It's
              barebones

              I have decided as I am just getting started that I will include
              all the early changes on this single page since they most likely
              won't be huge features. Since the last change (2 days ago) I have
              learned the very basics of flexbox, so I plan on redoing the
              landing page using that, I think it will be a good challenge to
              test how much I remember. Over the next week I will also be
              learning css grid, which may be replacing flexbox on the landing
              page, but too much practice is not a bad thing. Below I will
              include a picture of what the homepage looks like right now
              without flexbox

            <p>
              Yes it's very bad I'm aware, but I just wanted to get the basic
              elements down, I am going to try to switch the display to flexbox
              while keeping everything very similar

              As you can see there has been a decent amount of progress made.
              Below I will detail all the changes I have made today:

              <li class="list-item">
                Added Basis for Header (Need to figure out how to render on
                every page (might just need to copy code to each page??? There
                has to be a better way))
              </li>
              <li class="list-item">
                Drew a logo for myself, not a super creative one so most likely
                just a place holder, in case of change I will include the logo
                below
              </li>

              I have made a lot of progress over the last few days, including
              learning the basics of css grid, which has sparked a lot of new
              ideas, I am planning on revamping the entire look of the fron
              page, going for a desing that requires no scrolling. I want the
              front page to include a side bar rather than header bar with links
              to my social and to download my CV. Also, I want the front page to
              appear modular, made of boxes containing different info relevant
              to me.

            <h1 class="title">Major Updates</h1>
            <p>
              So since the last update I have been very very busy with the
              layout that I have somewhat neglected this page, I am aiming for
              the website to be at least presentable within the next few days,
              and I believe it will be. Also, the website is officially hosted
              now, I have revamped the layout with some cool effects, but there
              is still some content missing, the next two boxes will be the new
              landing page and the new version of the page you are on right now

            <p>
              Components are modular, growing/shrinking depending on screen
              size, also, some info is hidden if the page is not big enough
